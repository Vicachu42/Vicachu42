### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front End Development student with an interest in data analysis and visualization. I have a background in journalism, where my main speciality is how media content is produced and packaged to reach a larger audience. I also have a strong interest in data driven journalism, information security, and integrity.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and TypeScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-graf-3a4322131/?locale=en_US)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to crochet and mostly make [amigurumi](https://www.lovecrafts.com/en-gb/c/article/a-guide-to-amigurumi). Here is my [current WIP](https://ravel.me/Vicachu/aft)
